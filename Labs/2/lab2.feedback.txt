Michael, 

About your programs...

Functionality

- Could not test functionality because programs cannot be compiled. Root cause
  seems to be the fact that the name of the file does not match the name of
  your class.  -1pt

- Problem 3.11 is wrong. If I enter month 1 and year 2012, your program tells me that it
  has 28 days, which is incorrect!  -1pt

Please make sure you read the problems well; follow instructions.


Style Check

- There is incorrect indentation. -1pt

- Incorrect positioning of opening braces {   -1pt

- Most class names do not start with capital letter. They must.


Please make sure you follow the style guidelines and that your programs can be
compiled using javac. Penalties will be higher as the semester moves forward.

Peace,

- Dr. Rivas
