Michael,

About your essay...

- It seems like you think agile development is not a software development
  process, but it actually is.
- Good content
- Good length
- Good spelling and grammar


About your programs...

Functionality

- The output does not follow instructions given by program. 

- Problem 2.5 is wrong.  -1pt

- Problem 2.6 is wrong.  -1pt

Please make sure you read the problems well; follow instructions.


Style Check

- Most class names do not start with capital letter. They must.


Please make sure you follow the style guidelines and that your programs can be
compiled using javac. Penalties will be higher as the semester moves forward.

Peace,

- Dr. Rivas
